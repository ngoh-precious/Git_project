    <h1>Play with Kubernetes</h1>
    <p>
      Play with Kubernet (PWK) is a web-based kubernetes playground that you can
      use for free. All you need is a web browser and an internet connection. It
      is faster, easiest way to get your hands on kubernetes.
    </p>
    <p>Let's see what it looks like:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Point your browser to http://play-with-k8s.com</li>
      <img src="k8s/pwk0.webp" alt="Check your connection" /><br />
      <img src="k8s/pwk1.webp" alt="Check your connection" />
      <li>Confirm that you're a human and click + ADD NEW INSTANCE</li>
      <p>
        You will be presented with a terminal window in the right of your
        browser. This is a Kubernetes node (node1). Click on "ADD NEW INSTANCE". You should see an output like this;
      </p>
      <p>Run this command on node1 shell.</p>
      <img src="k8s/pwk2.webp" alt="Check your connection" />
      <p>
        You now have to run the second command "Initialize cluster
        networking". Run the second command on node1 shell. <br> You should see an output like this;
        <img src="k8s/pwk3.webp" alt="Check your connection">
        <p>

        </p>
      </p>
      <li>
        Run a few commands to see some of the components pre-installed on the
        node.
      </li>
    </ol>
